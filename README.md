# Airline Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes airline customer satisfaction data using Python. The script processes and explores the dataset, applying various data analysis techniques to understand factors that influence customer satisfaction. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and the application of machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the airline satisfaction dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
- **Visualization**: Creates visualizations to explore relationships between variables and customer satisfaction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models to predict customer satisfaction based on multiple features such as flight distance, service quality, and in-flight entertainment.

## Project Structure
- **`airline-sat.py`**: The main Python script that loads, processes, and analyzes the airline satisfaction dataset.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python is installed.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the following libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arnold-shakirov/Airline-Analysis-Statistics.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python airline-sat.py
    ```

### Output
The script will output:
- **Data Visualizations**: Charts and graphs visualizing relationships between variables and satisfaction levels.
- **Model Performance**: Accuracy and evaluation metrics for machine learning models predicting customer satisfaction.

#### Sample Output:
- Bar charts showing satisfaction by class of service.
- Classification report with model accuracy and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to airline customer experience and satisfaction. Key features include:
- **`Flight Distance`**: The distance of the flight in miles.
- **`Seat Comfort`**: A rating of how comfortable the seat was.
- **`In-flight Entertainment`**: A rating for the quality of in-flight entertainment.
- **`Customer Satisfaction`**: Whether the customer was satisfied with their experience (Yes/No).

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x** or higher
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models.

### Installing Libraries
To install the required libraries, use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
